Last week we attended PyCon US in a beautiful city of Pittsburgh, PA!

I've been on many conferences, but at PyCon I was amazed by the spacious venue, flawless event organization, high-quality content and welcoming community 😎, ...and good food 🍔!

We met a lot of great people and, especially, wonderful people from Beeware (hello Russell, Malcolm and Russell 👋). They did a great job of popularizing Python on mobile and advocating the addition of iOS and Android to the list of supported platforms in the next release of Python 3.13 🎉!

We enjoyed good talks and inspirational key notes, learned new things, enjoyed the city. Lightning talks (short 5-minute presentations) were real fun!

Oh, I saw Guido van Rossum (The Creator of Python himself, in case you didn't know 😅) at Microsoft booth, but didn't have a chance to take a picture with him as there was a line up 😉.

As first time attendees we did't do talks or presentations, but watched and learned instead.
We plan to present next year 🤞.

Next PyCon US is going to be at the same place. Will come again and hope to see more of you there!
