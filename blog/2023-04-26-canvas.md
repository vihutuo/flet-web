Unleash your inner artist üßë‚Äçüé® and boost your Flet creativity with brand-new [Canvas](/docs/controls/canvas) control just released in [Flet 0.6.0](https://pypi.org/project/flet/)!

Canvas enables you to draw arbitrary graphics using a set of primitives, or "shapes", such as line, circle, arc, path and text. I bet you can even implement your own version of [charts](/blog/flet-charts) using Canvas control!

Combine Canvas with [GestureDetector](/docs/controls/gesturedetector) and you get a free-hand drawing app - Flet Brush üòÄ!

[Example source](https://github.com/flet-dev/examples/blob/main/python/controls/canvas/canvas-flet-brush.py)

`Canvas` control is located in `flet.canvas` package. You need another import to use it:

```python
import flet.canvas as cv
```

Here's a simple program drawing a smiley face with [`Circle`](/docs/controls/canvas#circle-shape-properties) and [`Arc`](/docs/controls/canvas#arc-shape-properties) shapes using filled and stroke [`Paint`](/docs/reference/types/paint):

```python
import math
import flet as ft
import flet.canvas as cv

def main(page: ft.Page):
    stroke_paint = paint = ft.Paint(stroke_width=2, style=ft.PaintingStyle.STROKE)
    fill_paint = paint = ft.Paint(style=ft.PaintingStyle.FILL)
    cp = cv.Canvas(
        [
            cv.Circle(100, 100, 50, stroke_paint),
            cv.Circle(80, 90, 10, stroke_paint),
            cv.Circle(84, 87, 5, fill_paint),
            cv.Circle(120, 90, 10, stroke_paint),
            cv.Circle(124, 87, 5, fill_paint),
            cv.Arc(70, 95, 60, 40, 0, math.pi, paint=stroke_paint),
        ],
        width=float("inf"),
        expand=True,
    )

    page.add(cp)

ft.app(main)
```

## Other changes

### Rich text support

While working on [drawing text on Canvas](/docs/controls/canvas#drawing-text), as a bonus to this release, we implemented a new [`TextSpan`](/docs/reference/types/textspan) control which can now be used with [`Text.spans`](/docs/controls/text#spans) to output rich text.

<img src="/img/docs/controls/text/richtext-borders-stroke.png" className="screenshot-60" />

Check rich text examples: [one](/docs/controls/text#rich-text-basics), [two](/docs/controls/text#rich-text-with-borders-and-stroke) and [three](/docs/controls/text#rich-text-with-gradient).

### `url` property for buttons

If you need to open a URL by clicking on a button or any other control with `on_click` event you can just provide that URL in `url` instead of doing that in the code with [`page.launch_url()`](/docs/controls/page#launch_urlurl) method.

Instead of that:

```python
ft.ElevatedButton("Go to Google", on_click=lambda e: e.page.launch_url("https://google.com"))
```

you can just do this:

```python
ft.ElevatedButton("Go to Google", url="https://google.com")
```

A new `url` property also solves [blocked window on Safari](https://github.com/flet-dev/flet/issues/1105) issue.

### Auto-follow links in `Markdown`

As a continuation of `url` property `Markdown` control can now be enabled to auto-follow URLs in the document:

```python
import flet as ft

md = """
[Go to Google](https://www.google.com)
"""

def main(page: ft.Page):
    page.add(
        ft.Markdown(
            md,
            extension_set=ft.MarkdownExtensionSet.GITHUB_WEB,
            auto_follow_links=True,
        )
    )

ft.app(main)
```

### Better web support

In this release we also did some improvements to web support like [capturing user info in `page.client_id` and `page.client_user_agent`](https://github.com/flet-dev/flet/pull/1302) as well as fixing nasty [#1333](https://github.com/flet-dev/flet/pull/1333) and [#1289](https://github.com/flet-dev/flet/pull/1289) bugs related to routing.

That's all for today!

Upgrade Flet module to the latest version (`pip install flet --upgrade`), give canvas and rich text a try and [let us know](https://discord.gg/dzWXP8SHG8) what you think!
