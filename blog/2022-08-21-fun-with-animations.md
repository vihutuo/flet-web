Despite Flet release debuting animations support was released some time ago, we've just finished documenting its new features! We all know if the feature is not documented it just doesn't exist! ðŸ˜‰

Flutter offers [multiple approaches](https://docs.flutter.dev/development/ui/animations) for creating animations such "implicit", "explicit", "tween", "stagered", "pre-canned" animations as well as displaying animation scenes prepared in Rive and Lottie editors.

We are starting with "implicit" animations which allows you to animate a control property by setting a target value; whenever that target value changes, the control animates the property from the old value to the new one.

## Demo time

<div style={{fontSize: "1.1rem", textAlign: "center", padding: "1rem" }}>

</div>

[Explore demo sources](https://github.com/flet-dev/flet-heroku-app). The demo is hosted on Heroku, by the way, so you can use it as a starting point for your own deployments.

## Implicit animations

Implicit animations can be enabled for the following control properties:

* [Opacity](/docs/cookbook/animations#opacity-animation)
* [Rotation](/docs/cookbook/animations#rotation-animation) (new in this release)
* [Scale](/docs/cookbook/animations#scale-animation) (new in this release)
* [Offset](/docs/cookbook/animations#offset-animation) (new in this release)
* [Position](/docs/cookbook/animations#position-animation)

Additionally, all `Container` control properties [can be now animated](/docs/cookbook/animations#animated-container) and there is a new [`AnimatedSwitcher`](/docs/controls/animatedswitcher) control for animated transition between old a new content.

## Other new features

### `Markdown` control

Allows to render text in Markdown format. Supports various extensions: `CommonMark`, `GitHub Web` and `GitHub Flavored`.

[See `Markdown` control docs](/docs/controls/markdown) for more information and examples.

### URL launcher

`page.launch_url(url)` method allows programmatically opening a URL in a new browser window, for example:

```python
page.launch_url("https://google.com")
```

It also works nice with `Markdown` control for opening links within markdown document.

### Keyboard shortcuts

`Page` now contains [`on_keyboard_event`](/docs/controls/page#on_keyboard_event) event handlet to globally intercept all keystrokes.

Check this [simple usage example](https://github.com/flet-dev/examples/blob/main/python/controls/page/keyboard-events.py).

### Accessibility improvements

We added [Accessibility](/docs/cookbook/accessibility) section to the docs covering semantics support for screen readers.

### `ShaderMark` control

A control that applies a mask generated by a shader to its content. Allows making nice effects like [gradually fading out images](/docs/controls/shadermask#gradually-fade-out-image-to-the-bottom-edge).

That's it!
