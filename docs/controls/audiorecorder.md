title: AudioRecorder
sidebar_label: AudioRecorder
---

Audio recorder from microphone to a given file path. Works on macOS, Linux, Windows, iOS, Android and web.
Based on the [record](https://pub.dev/packages/record) Dart/Flutter package.

:::note
On Linux, encoding is provided by [fmedia](https://stsaz.github.io/fmedia/) which must be installed separately.
:::

AudioRecorder control is non-visual and should be added to `page.overlay` list.

:::info Packaging
To build your Flet app that uses `AudioRecorder` control add `flet-audio-recorder` to `dependencies` key of the `[project]` section of your `pyproject.toml` file, for
example:

```toml
[project]
...
dependencies = [
  "flet==0.27.6",
  "flet-audio-recorder==0.1.0",
]
```

import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';

## Examples

### Basic Example


```python reference
https://github.com/flet-dev/examples/blob/main/python/controls/utility/audio-recorder/audio-recorder-example.py
```


## Properties

:::note
Not all properties are supported on all platforms. Please check this [platform-feature parity matrix](https://pub.dev/packages/record#platform-feature-parity-matrix) for more information on which properties are supported on which platforms.
:::

### `audio_encoder`

The audio encoder to be used for recording.

Value is of type [`AudioEncoder`](/docs/reference/types/audioencoder) and defaults
to [`AudioEncoder.WAV`](/docs/reference/types/audioencoder#wav).

See [`this`](https://pub.dev/packages/record#file) for a detailed overview on the encodings supported by each platform.

### `auto_gain`

The recorder will try to auto adjust recording volume in a limited range.

Value is of type `bool` and defaults to `False`.

### `bit_rate`

The audio encoding bit rate in bits per second.

Value is of type [`OptionalNumber`](/docs/reference/types/aliases#optionalnumber) and defaults to `128000`.

### `cancel_echo`

The recorder will try to reduce echo.

Value is of type `bool` defaults to `False`.

### `channels_num`

The numbers of channels for the recording. `1` = mono, `2` = stereo.

Defaults to `2`.

### `sample_rate`

The sample rate for audio in samples per second.

Value is of type [`OptionalNumber`](/docs/reference/types/aliases#optionalnumber) and defaults to `44100`.

### `suppress_noise`

The recorder will try to negates the input noise.

Value is of type `bool` and defaults to `False`.

## Methods

### `cancel_recording()`

Stops and discards/deletes the file/blob.

### `get_input_devices()`

Returns a dictionary whose values are the input devices available on the platform.

### `has_permission()`

Checks (and optionally requests) for audio record permission.

### `is_paused()`

Checks if recording session is paused.

### `is_recording()`

Checks if there's a valid recording session. Note that if the recording session is paused, this method will still return `True`.

### `is_supported_encoder(encoder)`

Checks if the given `encoder` is supported on the current platform.

### `pause()`

Pauses recording session.

### `resume()`

Resumes recording session after pause.

### `seek(position_milliseconds)`

Moves the cursor to the desired position.

### `start_recording(output_path)`

Starts new recording session on the specified `output_path`. On platforms other than web, the `output_path` must be provided.

### `stop_recording()`

Stops recording session and release internal recorder resource. It returns a string which is the location of the recorded file. On web, it returns the blob which could be opened using [`page.lauch_url()`](/docs/controls/page#launch_urlurl). On other platforms, it returns the path to the file which is the `output_path` parameter passed to `start_recording()` method.

## Events

### `on_state_changed`

Fires when audio recorder's state changes.

Event handler argument is of
type [`AudioRecorderStateChangeEvent`](/docs/reference/types/audiorecorderstatechangeevent).
