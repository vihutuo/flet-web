## Properties

### `figure`

Plotly figure to draw - an instance of `plotly.graph_objects.Figure` class.

### `original_size`

`True` to display chart in original size. `False` (default) to display a chart that fits configured bounds.

### `isolated`

Every time when a page or parent chart control are updated with `page.update()` or `Control.update()` methods respectively the chart is re-drawn by calling Plotly API. Frequent re-drawings of large charts could affect the performance of the entire Flet app.

Set `isolated` to `True` to enable explicit chart updates. To re-draw the chart call its `update()` method.
