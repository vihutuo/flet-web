Text buttons are used for the lowest priority actions, especially when presenting multiple options. Text buttons can be placed on a variety of backgrounds. Until the button is interacted with, its container isn’t visible. See [Material 3 buttons](https://m3.material.io/components/buttons/overview) for more info.
