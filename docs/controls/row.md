A control that displays its children in a horizontal array.

To cause a child control to expand and fill the available horizontal space set its `expand` property.

import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';

## Properties

### `alignment`

How the child Controls should be placed horizontally.

Value is of type [`MainAxisAlignment`](/docs/reference/types/mainaxisalignment) and defaults
to `MainAxisAlignment.START`.

### `auto_scroll`

`True` if scrollbar should automatically move its position to the end when children updated. Must be `False` for `scroll_to()` method to work.

### `controls`

A list of Controls to display inside the Row.

### `rtl`

`True` to set text direction to right-to-left.

Defaults to `False`.

### `run_alignment`

How the runs should be placed in the cross-axis when `wrap=True`.

Value is of type [`MainAxisAlignment`](/docs/reference/types/mainaxisalignment) and defaults to `MainAxisAlignment.START`.

### `run_spacing`

Spacing between runs when `wrap=True`.

Defaults to `10`.

### `scroll`

Enables horizontal scrolling for the Row to prevent its content overflow.

Value is of type [`ScrollMode`](/docs/reference/types/scrollmode).

### `spacing`

Spacing between controls in a row. Default value is 10 virtual pixels. Spacing is applied only when `alignment` is set
to `MainAxisAlignment.START`, `MainAxisAlignment.END` or `MainAxisAlignment.CENTER`.

### `on_scroll_interval`

Throttling in milliseconds for `on_scroll` event.

Defaults to `10`.

### `tight`

Specifies how much space should be occupied horizontally.

Defaults to `False`, meaning all space is allocated to children.

### `vertical_alignment`

How the child Controls should be placed vertically.

Value is of type [`CrossAxisAlignment`](/docs/reference/types/crossaxisalignment) and defaults
to `CrossAxisAlignment.START`.

### `wrap`

When set to `True` the Row will put child controls into additional rows (runs) if they don't fit a single row.

## Methods

### `scroll_to(offset, delta, key, duration, curve)`

Moves scroll position to either absolute `offset`, relative `delta` or jump to the control with specified `key`.

See [`Column.scroll_to()`](/docs/controls/column#scroll_tooffset-delta-key-duration-curve) for method details and examples.

## Events

### `on_scroll`

Fires when scroll position is changed by a user.

Event handler argument is an instance of [`OnScrollEvent`](/docs/reference/types/onscrollevent) class.

## Expanding children

When a child Control is placed into a Row you can "expand" it to fill the available space. Every Control has `expand` property that can have either a boolean value (`True` - expand control to fill all available space) or an integer - an "expand factor" specifying how to divide a free space with other expanded child controls. For example, this code creates a row with a TextField taking all available space and an ElevatedButton next to it:

```python
r = ft.Row([
  ft.TextField(hint_text="Enter your name", expand=True),
  ft.ElevatedButton(text="Join chat")
])
```

The following example with numeric expand factors creates a Row with 3 containers in it and having widths of `20% (1/5)`, `60% (3/5)` and `20% (1/5)` respectively:

```python
r = ft.Row([
  ft.Container(expand=1, content=ft.Text("A")),
  ft.Container(expand=3, content=ft.Text("B")),
  ft.Container(expand=1, content=ft.Text("C"))
])
```

In general, the resulting width of a child in percents is calculated as `expand / sum(all expands) * 100%`.

If you need to give the child Control of the Row the flexibility to expand to fill the available space horizontally but not require it to fill the available space, set its `expand_loose` property to `True`.
